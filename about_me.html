                <h3>Developer <span>& Designer</span></h3>
                <p>I am a full stack developer but majorly skilled as a front-end web developer. <br> I can provide clean code and pixel-perfect design. I also make the website <br>more & more interactive with web animations. A responsive design makes your <br>website accessible to all users, regardless of their device.</p>
                <p>I also specialize in crafting intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces with a keen focus on user experience. <br>My proficiency in UI/UX design extends to using industry-standard tools such as Figma, where I bring concepts <br>to life through wireframing, prototyping, and creating design systems. I believe that a seamless user experience <br>goes hand-in-hand with a visually striking design. Through my expertise in Figma, I meticulously design user <br>interfaces that not only meet the functional requirements but also prioritize a delightful user journey. <br>This combination of technical development skills and a passion for design allows me to create websites <br>that are not only responsive and functional but also aesthetically pleasing and user-centric.</p>
